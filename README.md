# Predicting-the-Strength-of-high-performance-concrete
* __Course:__ Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning. 
* __Skills and Tools:__ Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering. 

This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.
